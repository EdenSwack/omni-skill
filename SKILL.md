## What is Omni?

Omni is a BI platform that combines a governed shared data model with the freedom of SQL. It sits on top of a data warehouse (Snowflake at Tavily) and provides:
- A semantic modeling layer (topics, views, dimensions, measures, joins)
- A workbook/dashboard builder
- Point-and-click query building against modeled topics
- Raw SQL tiles for custom queries
- AI-assisted query building via natural language

All queries — whether point-and-click, AI, or SQL — are mediated through the semantic layer.

---

## Architecture: The Three Model Layers

| Layer | What it is | Who edits it |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema model** | Auto-generated from database structure | Managed by Omni |
| **Shared model** | Governed org-wide definitions (dimensions, measures, joins, topics) | Modelers / Connection Admins |
| **Workbook model** | Per-workbook extensions/overrides for ad hoc analysis | Anyone |

**Development flow:** Start in a workbook or branch → validate logic → promote to shared model → eventually push to dbt/database layer.

Branches support Git-style workflows: create branch → develop → submit PR → merge to shared.

---

## Omni vs Looker

| Concept | Looker | Omni |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic layer | LookML | YAML model (similar syntax) |
| Explore | Explore | Topic |
| View | View | View |
| Dimension/Measure | Same | Same |
| Derived table | Derived table | SQL view or workbook SQL |
| Branch development | N/A | Branch mode + git |
| Raw SQL | SQL Runner | SQL tab in workbook |
| Custom logic | LookML only | Workbook model OR shared model |

Key difference: in Omni you can model directly in the workbook without touching the shared model first. The shared model is opt-in, not required.

---

## Topics

A **topic** is a curated, queryable dataset — the primary unit of self-service analytics in Omni. Topics define which views (tables) are joined together, which fields are visible, and how users interact with the data. Topics are required for natural-language AI querying, so topic quality directly affects AI reliability.

### Important: Topic file location (as of December 2024)
The `topics:` field inside model files is **deprecated**. Topics must now be defined in their own dedicated topic files in the IDE. Existing model files containing `topics:` may still function, but new topics should not be added there.

### How to think about topics
- Treat topics as a presentation and curation layer on top of the underlying model
- The underlying model reflects technical structure; the topic should reflect business use cases
- Prefer business-friendly naming, labels, descriptions, and grouping over raw warehouse naming
- A single table can power multiple topics for different business use cases

### Topic best practices
- Create multiple smaller, focused topics instead of one large one
- Start with core datasets and the questions users most commonly ask
- Use granular base tables with many-to-one joins; avoid many-to-many joins
- Curate available fields so the field picker is clean and understandable
- Apply `required_access_grants` to restrict topic visibility by user attribute
- Set `default_filters` to ensure appropriate data scoping (e.g. exclude deleted records)
- Use `hidden` and `ignored` parameters to reduce field clutter
- Use `always_where_sql` for permanent hard filters (e.g. enterprise-only topics)
- Add `ai_context` and `sample_queries` when the topic will be used with Omni AI
- If a topic has dozens of joins and hundreds of fields, it is too broad — split it

### Topic parameters (complete reference)

| Parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `base_view` | Required. Defines the primary grain of analysis |
| `label` | Display name in the topic picker |
| `description` | Free text description shown to users |
| `group_label` | Groups topics in the picker (folder-like organization) |
| `fields` | Curates available fields (include/exclude specific fields) |
| `joins` | Views and relationships included in the topic |
| `relationships` | Topic-level join definitions |
| `views` | Topic-scoped customization of specific views |
| `ai_fields` | Curates which fields are exposed specifically to AI (separate from `fields`) |
| `ai_context` | Describes business meaning and intended usage for AI |
| `sample_queries` | Example questions users can start from |
| `access_filters` | Row-level access based on user attributes |
| `required_access_grants` | Gates access to the entire topic |
| `default_filters` | Visible default filters that users can remove |
| `always_where_filters` | Enforced filters users cannot remove (structured) |
| `always_where_sql` | Enforced SQL WHERE clause users cannot remove |
| `cache_policy` | Topic-level cache behavior / TTL |
| `auto_run` | Requires explicit run clicks — prevents expensive accidental queries |
| `hidden` | Removes topic from workbook browsing |
| `owners` | List of topic owners for accountability |
| `extends` | Inherit and override another topic (powerful for variants) |
| `warehouse_override` | Route queries to a different compute warehouse |

### Topic YAML example (Tavily-relevant)
```yaml
# Enterprise Usage topic
label: Enterprise Usage
base_view: monthly_company_usage_summary
group_label: Usage
always_where_sql: "${company.entity_type} = 'contract'"
joins:
  - name: company
    from: company_consolidation_full_complete
    sql_on: "${monthly_company_usage_summary.company_name} = ${company.company_name}"
    relationship: many_to_one
    type: left_outer
ai_context: "Use this topic for analyzing usage patterns of enterprise (contract) customers. Base grain is monthly company-level usage cost."
```

### Topic security
- `required_access_grants` — restricts which users can see the topic
- `default_topic_required_access_grants` — applies an access grant across all topics in the model
- `access_boostable: true` — allows AccessBoost to elevate permissions for embed use cases
- Dashboard tiles for Restricted Queriers and Viewers must be built on topics unless AccessBoost is enabled

### Workbook vs IDE for topics

| Task | Where |
|---|---|
| Create a topic visually from scratch | Workbook only (Queriers) |
| Edit an existing topic | Workbook (Model > Edit topic) or IDE |
| Set cache policy, access grants, default filters | IDE only |
| Convert "All Views & Fields" query to topic | Workbook (Save as topic) |
| Define topic files in YAML | IDE only |

---

## Views

A **view** maps to a database table or SQL-defined dataset. Fields (dimensions and measures) are defined within views. Views are the building blocks that topics assemble.

### View parameters
- `sql_table_name` — maps view to a physical table
- `derived_table` / `sql` — defines a virtual table using SQL
- `label` — human-readable name shown in the UI
- `hidden` — hides the view from the topic picker
- `primary_key` — required for correct join behavior and symmetric aggregates
- `access_filters` — row-level security filters based on user attributes

---

## Dimensions

A dimension is an attribute that describes a row of data. Used for grouping, filtering, and segmenting.

### Dimension types
- String, number, boolean, date/time
- Date dimensions auto-generate timeframes (day, week, month, quarter, year) unless restricted

### Key dimension parameters
- `sql` — the underlying SQL expression
- `type` — data type (string, number, yesno, date, time, datetime)
- `label` — UI display name
- `description` — shown in field picker tooltip
- `group_label` — groups fields together in the field picker
- `hidden` — hides from UI but keeps available for SQL references
- `primary_key: true` — marks the grain of the view; required for fan-out protection
- `timeframes` — controls which date granularities are exposed
- `convert_tz: false` — disables timezone conversion for UTC-safe dates
- `required_access_grants` — restricts field visibility
- `mask_unless_access_grants` — shows field but masks value unless user has grant
- `level_of_detail` — controls aggregation granularity independently from query grouping
- `drill_fields` — defines fields to show when drilling into this dimension
- `links` — adds clickable URL links to dimension values
- `suggestion_list` / `suggest_from_field` — controls filter suggestions
- `format` — display format (e.g. date format strings)
- `sample_values` — hints for AI query generation
- `synonyms` — alternative names for AI recognition

### Dimension YAML example
```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: company_name
    label: Company Name
    sql: "${TABLE}.company_name"
    description: "Legal entity name of the customer"

  - name: usage_month
    label: Usage Month
    sql: "${TABLE}.usage_month"
    timeframes: [month, quarter, year]
    convert_tz: false
```

---

## Measures

A measure aggregates data across rows. Used for KPIs, totals, averages, ratios.

### Key measure parameters
- `sql` — the expression being aggregated
- `aggregate_type` — sum, count, count_distinct, average, max, min, median, list
- `type: number` — for compound metrics (measure referencing other measures)
- `label`, `description`, `group_label` — same as dimensions
- `format` — e.g. `usdcurrency`, `percent`, `decimal:2`
- `filters` — filtered measures (conditional aggregation)
- `drill_fields` / `drill_queries` — drill-down behavior
- `required_access_grants` — restricts visibility
- `custom_primary_key_sql` — overrides the primary key for symmetric aggregation
- `hidden`, `ignored`
- `sample_values`, `synonyms` — AI optimization hints

### Measure YAML examples
```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_arr
    label: Total ARR
    sql: "${TABLE}.arr"
    aggregate_type: sum
    format: usdcurrency

  - name: mrr
    label: MRR
    sql: "${total_arr} / 12"
    format: usdcurrency

  - name: active_customers
    label: Active Customers
    sql: "${TABLE}.customer_id"
    aggregate_type: count_distinct

  # Filtered measure (enterprise only)
  - name: enterprise_arr
    label: Enterprise ARR
    sql: "${TABLE}.arr"
    aggregate_type: sum
    filters:
      - field: company.entity_type
        value: contract

  # Ratio metric with null safety
  - name: win_rate
    label: Win Rate
    sql: "1.0 * ${won_deals} / nullif(${total_deals}, 0)"
    type: number
    format: percent
```

### Symmetric aggregates
Omni automatically applies symmetric aggregation to prevent fan-out on joins when `primary_key` is set. Always prefer `aggregate_type` over raw SQL aggregations when joining. For custom scenarios, use `custom_primary_key_sql`.

### Semi-additive measures
Use `omni_dimensionalize` for values like account balances that sum across some dimensions but not others (e.g. sum across accounts but not across time — take the latest value instead).

---

## Joins

Joins define relationships between views. They are defined in a `relationships` file in the model IDE and referenced in topics.

### Join parameters
- `from` / `to` — the two views being joined
- `sql_on` — the join condition
- `relationship` — `many_to_one`, `one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, `many_to_many`
- `type` — `left`, `inner`, `full_outer`

### Join best practices
- Use many-to-one joins (fact to dimension); avoid many-to-many
- Always set `primary_key` on the base view to enable symmetric aggregation
- Use `type: left_outer` unless inner join is explicitly needed
- Omni can infer relationships via the UI when cardinality is unknown
- Even with many joins defined, Omni only brings in the required join path for a given query — but topic sprawl still hurts usability

---

## Field References

Reference fields using `${ }` syntax:
- `${view_name.field_name}` — cross-view reference
- `${field_name}` — within the same view
- `${field_name//}` — raw SQL value (bypasses Omni processing)

Never use raw table/column names in model SQL — always use `${ }` syntax so Omni can track dependencies.

---

## Filters

### Filter syntax in YAML
```yaml
filters:
  status: "paid"
  created_date: "last 30 days"
  amount: ">100"
```

### Filter operators (commonly used)
- `is`, `not`, `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`
- `greater_than`, `less_than`, `between`
- `before`, `on_or_after`, `between_dates`
- `field_name_in_query` — dynamic filter matching another field in the same query

---

## SQL in Omni

### Two modes

| Mode | How | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Model-based query** | Point-and-click from topic | Standard dashboard tiles, reusable queries |
| **SQL tab** | Raw SQL against the database | Complex logic, exploration, one-off queries |

SQL tabs bypass the model layer entirely — no field picker, no topic joins, results are non-editable but can be charted and added to dashboards.

### Templated filters in SQL
```sql
WHERE {{# order_items.created_at.filter }}
```
Wires a dashboard filter control into SQL automatically.

### Omni SQL functions
- `OMNI_MONTH()`, `OMNI_YEAR()`, `OMNI_WEEK()`, `OMNI_QUARTER()`, `OMNI_DATE` — date extraction
- `OMNI_RUNNING_TOTAL()` — running total
- `OMNI_RANK()` — ranking
- `OMNI_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL()` — percent of total
- `OMNI_PERCENT_CHANGE_FROM_PREVIOUS()` — period-over-period change

### SQL generation
Omni auto-generates SQL from point-and-click queries. Use the SQL inspector (top-right button) to view and debug generated SQL. Command+Enter executes modified queries.

---

## Development Workflows

### Workbook to shared model
1. Build and validate logic in a workbook
2. Use **Model > View & promote changes** to review a YAML diff
3. Select which fields/joins to promote
4. Click **Promote to shared**

### Branch mode
1. Create a branch from the shared model
2. Develop in the model IDE (full YAML editing)
3. Submit a PR → merge to shared
4. Use Content Validator to check that promoted changes don't break existing dashboards

### Schema refreshes
Run a schema refresh when the database schema changes (new tables, renamed columns, type changes). The IDE will flag broken field references.

---

## Performance Optimization

### Caching
- Caching policies can be set at shared, workbook, or topic level
- Configure `cache_policy` with TTL values
- Clear cache or set `cache_policy: 0` during testing
- Use `auto_run: false` on large topics to prevent expensive accidental queries

### Aggregate awareness
Omni can route queries to pre-aggregated tables:
1. Build aggregate tables (e.g. via dbt)
2. Add a `materialized_query` parameter mapping the aggregate to the underlying views
3. Verify via the SQL inspector that queries route to the aggregate table

Best practices:
- Field order in `materialized_query` must match dimension ordering in the aggregate table
- All queried fields must exist in the aggregated table
- `count_distinct` at different granularities won't benefit from aggregate awareness
- Push heavy aggregations into Snowflake (Gold/Silver tables) rather than computing in Omni

---

## Access Control

### Column-level security
- `required_access_grants` on dimensions/measures — hides field entirely
- `mask_unless_access_grants` — shows field label but masks value

### Row-level security
- `access_filters` on views — filters rows to match user attribute values
- Defined per-topic or as defaults across the model
- `values_for_unfiltered` — allows admins to bypass row filters

### Topic-level security
- `required_access_grants` on topics — controls who can see the topic
- `always_where_sql` / `always_where_filters` — enforced, non-removable filters
- `default_filters` — visible defaults users can remove
- User attributes are the source of truth for access filter values (no defaults set automatically)

### Access grants pattern
```yaml
# In model file
access_grants:
  enterprise_only:
    user_attribute: customer_tier
    allowed_values: [enterprise]

# On topic
required_access_grants: [enterprise_only]

# On view (row-level)
access_filters:
  - field: orders.region
    user_attribute: region
```

## AI Optimization

To improve Omni AI query generation on a topic:
- Add `description` to views, dimensions, and measures (AI reads these)
- Add `ai_context` at the topic level to describe business meaning and intended use
- Use `ai_fields` to curate exactly which fields AI can use (separate from `fields`)
- Add `sample_queries` to show AI the kinds of questions the topic is designed for
- Add `sample_values` to dimensions with non-obvious values
- Add `synonyms` for fields with alternative business names
- Keep topics focused — AI gets cleaner context from smaller, scoped topics

---

## MCP Integration (Omni + Claude Code)

Omni has an MCP server connected to this Claude Code session. Available tools:
- `pickTopic` — select the right Omni topic for a query
- `getData` — run a natural language query against a topic and return results as a table

**Workflow:**
1. `pickTopic` — choose the topic that has the relevant data
2. `getData` with a natural language prompt — Omni generates and executes the SQL
3. Results come back as a table

---

## Dashboard Best Practices

- Design focused dashboards for specific audiences and decisions
- Use KPI tiles for top-line metrics
- Use KPI tiles, headers, and markdown tiles for structure and context
- Define `drill_fields` on measures to enable deeper exploration
- Use `links` on dimensions to connect to related content
- Apply consistent color schemes and simplified axis labels
- Use scheduled delivery to proactively share data
- Label and verify trusted dashboards for discoverability

---

## Common Modeling Patterns

### Enterprise-only enforced filter
```yaml
always_where_sql: "${company.entity_type} = 'contract'"
```

### Date spine / time series
Use a calendar/date dimension table joined as many-to-one to ensure continuous time series even on days with no activity.

### Topic that extends another
```yaml
extends: base_usage_topic
label: Enterprise Usage
always_where_sql: "${company.entity_type} = 'contract'"
```

---

## Key Things to Watch For

- **Fan-out risk**: Always set `primary_key` on views used in joins; use symmetric aggregation
- **Many-to-many joins**: Avoid — leads to incorrect aggregation
- **Date timezone issues**: Use `convert_tz: false` for UTC-safe timestamps
- **Over-broad topics**: Break into focused topics instead of one giant one
- **Missing descriptions**: Poor AI query quality results from undocumented fields
- **Promoting too early**: Validate in workbook/branch before pushing to shared model
- **Grain mismatches**: Confirm aggregation level before creating measures
- **Topics in model files**: Deprecated as of December 2024 — use dedicated topic files
- **Viewer/Restricted Querier tiles**: Must be built on topics unless AccessBoost is enabled
- **`ai_fields` vs `fields`**: These are separate — curate both if the topic will be used with AI
